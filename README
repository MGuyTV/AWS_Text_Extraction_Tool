#This readme file is meant to explain how this program works and how to run it.

#For starters, the end user must have aws cli already installed on their
environment in order to this code.

#There are also several depencencies that the end user must install in
order to run this application:

-If you are on a Unix based operating system and have the apt package
manager installed run these commands to install the extra dependencies:

python3 -m pip install reportlab

pip install fpdf

pip install boto3

#If you do not have pip installed first run this command than the ones above
sudo apt install python3-pip

#After this run python3 Converter.py


#This program is meant to extract text from a .png image and output it into
#a pdf file with that text. The file will also be added to an S3 bucket
#along with the original .png file. You will also be sent an email
#and a message on amazon sqs notifying you of your transaction.
#Additionally, the name of the .png file will be added to a dynamodb
database to help users keep track of what files have already been used.

#On one last note, the machine learning service Textract was used to
extract the text from the file.
